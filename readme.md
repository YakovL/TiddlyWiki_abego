This repository contains TiddlyWiki Classic plugins created by Udo Borkowski,
a prominent author who created such important pieces such as
ForEachTiddlerPlugin, IntelliTaggerPlugin, and YourSearchPlugin.

Sadly, Udo is no longer with us, and this repository serves as the central hub
for maintaining the plugins, clarifying which ones are deprecated or have preferred forks,
and indexing them for [ExtensionsExplorerPlugin](https://github.com/YakovL/TiddlyWiki_ExtensionsExplorerPlugin).

The `original` folder contains the repository untouched, as it was on https://tiddlywiki.abego-software.de/,
now available at https://yakovl.github.io/TiddlyWiki_abego/original/.
The `maintained` folder contains the updated content,
available at https://yakovl.github.io/TiddlyWiki_abego/maintained/.
