This repository contains TiddlyWiki Classic plugins created by Udo Borkowski,
a prominent author who created such important pieces as
ForEachTiddlerPlugin, IntelliTaggerPlugin, and YourSearchPlugin.

Sadly, Udo is no longer with us, and the repository is meant to be a central point
to maintain the plugins, to clarify which ones are deprecated or have preferred forks,
and index for [ExtensionsExplorerPlugin](https://github.com/YakovL/TiddlyWiki_ExtensionsExplorerPlugin).
