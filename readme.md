This repository contains TiddlyWiki Classic plugins created by Udo Borkowski,
a prominent author who created such important pieces as
ForEachTiddlerPlugin, IntelliTaggerPlugin, and YourSearchPlugin.

Sadly, [Udo is no longer with us](https://github.com/abego/YourSearchPlugin/issues/3#issuecomment-2531933217),
and this repository serves as the central hub for maintaining the plugins,
clarifying which ones are deprecated or have preferred forks,
and indexing them for [ExtensionsExplorerPlugin](https://github.com/YakovL/TiddlyWiki_ExtensionsExplorerPlugin).

The `original` folder contains [the repository untouched](https://yakovl.github.io/TiddlyWiki_abego/original/),
as it was on [the abego site](https://tiddlywiki.abego-software.de/).
The `maintained` folder contains [the up-to-date content](https://yakovl.github.io/TiddlyWiki_abego/maintained/),
maintained by the community.

Thanks Udo, for your generosity, your kindness, and your patience.
